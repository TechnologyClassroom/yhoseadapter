NOTE: We are still in the testing and design phase.  This is not recommended for clinical use at this time, but we are seeking testing.

The goal of this project is to create an adapter than can be used to split the output and input of a ventilator to extend its usage during an extreme emergency situation.  All splits of this concept would require all of the proper filters that would normally be used with a ventilator.
